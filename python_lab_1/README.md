# Python Lab 1

This is the first python lab of Alto AIoT Academy.
This lab is about how to get the weather data from https://openweathermap.org/ using an API key.
Then, send the notification via LINE to the user every 4 hours.

To run this code, run only app.py, then this file will use helper.py to use some useful functions.

Any changes such as location of desired place, other API keys, timesleep etc. can be changed in config.json
